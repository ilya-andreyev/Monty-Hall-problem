          Hello! Welcome to the page dedicated to the Monty Hall problem. This
          is one of the well-known problems in probability theory based on the
          American TV game show "Let's Make a Deal," and it is named after the
          host of the show. Imagine that you are a participant in a game where
          you need to choose one of three doors. Behind one of the doors is a
          car, and behind the other two doors are goats. You choose one of the
          doors, for example, number 1. After this, the host, who knows where
          the car and the goats are, opens one of the remaining doors, for
          example, number 3, behind which there is a goat. The host then asks
          you if you would like to change your choice. Logic tells us that the
          probability of finding the car behind the doors is the same: 50/50.
          However, if you make several attempts, it turns out that you will win
          more often if you change your choice from the initial door.
